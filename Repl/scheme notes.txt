Async notes

client returns synchronously -- get result and keep going
client returns asynchronbously -- return stepper and get result later

server returns synchronously
server returns asynchronously

server calls client async, return all the way back;
  eventually return when client is done

fibonacci -- returns a different value each call
primes -- returns the nth prime
